FBLiberator
===========

Chrome extension to help you get off Facebook by allowing you to download your entire FB timeline including images and comments, then delete all posts.

Unfortunately this project wasn't completed. 'Download the full timeline' works, but fails on slower computers. 'Delete all posts' was never written.

If anyone out there is interested in taking this extension to completion, please let me know and I'll be happy to help you get started.
